Problem:>>> Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
            If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Query:>>> select CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY)ASC, city LIMIT 1; 

          select CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY)DESC, city LIMIT 1;
